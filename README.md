GECKO ENCRYPTION README

GECKO encryption source code.
Faster, smaller, and with better diffusion than AES

Gecko is what is known as a substitution-permutation network.
Gecko operates on a block size of 128 bits, with three different key lengths supported: 128, 192 and 256 bits.

Gecko is written in standard C without any support libraries other than the standard C libraries.
Gecko is highly portable and is easily ported to hardware, server-side encryption, or application based.

Gecko is intended to me used anywhere you need small, fast and secure encryption.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Currently, I hold two US issued software patents, one of which is issued internationally. I have 3+ decades experience as a software architect and 16 years’ experience as an intellectual property researcher specializing in security. I've delivered 1/2 a dozen shrink-wrap retail software packages to market and spent 3 years at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).
One of my inventions was FAXGrabber. It was the first PC software to combine the then new PC Fax boards with Optical Character Recognition. Bill Gates thought it was so cool he personally demoed it at COMDEX ’92 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95b7QrRUfBE
